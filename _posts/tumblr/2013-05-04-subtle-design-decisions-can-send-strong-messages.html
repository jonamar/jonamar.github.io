  Subtle design decisions can send strong messages. Sometimes the wrong message. Replacing the community’s star rating with, “Editors’ Choice” sends the message that the editor’s judgments are more important than those of the community that they serve. A problematic message to send to your customers. Especially when we know that the 'intelligence of the swarm' is nearly always more accurate than the individual. 
  Of course, it’s easier to critique than it is to make.
