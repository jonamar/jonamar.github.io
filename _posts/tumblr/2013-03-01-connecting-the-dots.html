<a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/88876">Connecting the Dots</a><br/><p>A wonderful discussion of the options involved in connecting a lowercase &#8220;r&#8221; and &#8220;i&#8221; into a single character, which is known in typography circles as aÂ ligature. <strong>Such a beautiful solution to an awkward problem.</strong></p>
