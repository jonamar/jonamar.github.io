<p><strong>Good Enough is something we&#8217;re taught to be ashamed of. </strong>But Good Enough is the Goldilocks of solutions. It&#8217;s the right amount of good. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s examine this.</p>
<p>Like all creative and effortful endeavors, Design is an emotional undertaking. We work hard, we put in time. <strong>We get invested.</strong> That&#8217;s what investment is: the putting in of resources. But investment can make it really difficult to see where true value lies. To see what we&#8217;re working towards, instead of what we have to lose.</p>
<p>In so many ways, Design is finding solutions within limited resources – whether they&#8217;re budgets, time, users&#8217; needs, stakeholder priorities (ourselves included), technology, whatever. But there&#8217;s nuance here that&#8217;s so important. The best problem solving isn&#8217;t about working <em>within things</em>, be it budgets or time, <strong>it&#8217;s about conceiving of limitations as fundamental to the solution. </strong>The problem, the solution, the limitations. They&#8217;re all the same thing. </p>
<p>Esoteric? </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this on JonAmar.com (and not a feed reader of some sort) take a look around you. The design of this site is &#8230; adequate. It&#8217;s not particularly pretty. It&#8217;s not particularly original.<strong> It&#8217;s not even fantastically functional. It&#8217;s just good enough.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And that&#8217;s why I chose it.</strong> The problem I was solving when starting this blog didn&#8217;t require a fancier solution. I wanted somewhere to share my ideas. That was it. So I didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time worrying about having the perfect theme.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes that choice feels like failure. But then I take a deep breath and remember that this is what good Design is.</strong> And it when I do that, it feels&#8230; </p>
