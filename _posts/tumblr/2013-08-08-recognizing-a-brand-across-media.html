<p>I recently fell across a brilliant new CMS called <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/">Craft</a>. It seems to be the breath of fresh air I&#8217;ve been looking for&#8230; at least, one of them. It&#8217;s made by what I assume is a small team and they&#8217;re doing a tremendous job putting together all their documentation, communities, etc. There&#8217;s a lot going on and the real job of running a company comes down to prioritizing. So, I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;ve probably actually made the right decision in not paying attention to the detail I&#8217;m about to bring up&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Enough Flattery, Here&#8217;s my Gripe</strong></p>
<p>We come into contact with a brand in a lot of places. The locations are familiar: Website, Twitter, Google+, Facebook, Github, et al. Modern brands aren&#8217;t traditional corner groceries — same location, same signage, same aisles — but our brains are the same and they need something to hitch some neurons to, we need to make our brands recognizable and that means one big thing: consistency. </p>
<p><strong>Three Places Where I&#8217;ve Encountered Craft</strong></p>

<p>Their G+ Support Group</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m flipping through my dozens of tabs, mental modes, and the brands attached to them — some of which I&#8217;ve just come to discover — it&#8217;s so important for each visual impression of a brand to be strong and consistent, in every place it&#8217;s encountered. </p>
