<p>Any TV series, whether it&#8217;s procedural or serialized, needs to be more than a 1-trick pony. A show starts with a premise and a handful of characters. And both need to be good enough to hook people from the start. But if things don&#8217;t evolve, if plot lines don&#8217;t expand, if characters aren&#8217;t flushed out, then everything falls flat pretty quickly. Things become predicable and we lose interest.</p>
<p>Growing a TV series means scaling up. It means expanding on characters, backstory, subplots, and story arcs. In short: adding complexity. But complexity is a tricky thing. A balance must between struck between the familiar and the surprising. We need emotional anchors, we need investment, and those things grow over time. The more we come to know characters, the more we identify with &amp; love them. That&#8217;s human nature — loving, growing attached. But so is being fickle. There&#8217;s a sea of options forever at the tip of our fingers. Great TV shows make us forget about all that.</p>
<p>So much comes down to art of wielding surprise. Surprise can be surprisingly delightful or embarrassingly confusing. We don&#8217;t want to feel the fool. The twist at the end of a great mystery that feels inevitable in hindsight, but was totally unexpected, is deeply satisfying. That feeling lives on the high wire between foundations laid — relationships and plots explored — and the delightfully unforeseeable.</p>
<p>And yet there are so many ways to trip up. So many shows wind up entangled in their base habits. An epic plot ceases to be epic if its grows and scales predictably. Humans are inborn pattern recognizers; continual surprise stops being surprising; even exponential growth is still a pattern. Which is why a giant explosion can feel like one more fist fight. And context is wider that our own backyard. In the 80s explosions were exciting, today they&#8217;re old hat. Creators are competing not only with themselves but also with the audience&#8217;s expectations. And those are established in the repetitions of the medium as a whole. What was surprising a year, or a moment, ago may be predictable in the next.</p>
<p>So: predictability and surprise. Two sides of the double-edge sword that protect us from boredom and stagnation. We need and demand them. But whipped around thoughtlessly, our tools can just as easily be self-destructive. It&#8217;s the nuances, the attention to detail, the honoring of the person who is giving us their attention, which provides us with value and satisfaction. Whatever you&#8217;re growing to scale — a TV show, a startup — complexity is a necessity. It can also be a boon, if you know how to wield it.</p>
