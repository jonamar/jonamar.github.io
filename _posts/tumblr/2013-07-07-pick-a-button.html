<p>Love you Wordpress folks, so I thought I&#8217;d lend a hand and point out an issue on your home page:Â </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/6c5849ebd46b2c98f4a5818b8d8ba558/tumblr_inline_mpl106hMCt1qz4rgp.png" width="500"/></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a problematic lack of clarity in terms of what action people visiting this site are supposed to take. We&#8217;ve got two competing buttons that accomplish the same task, combined with a screenshot of the app&#8217;s UI which features a third, identically styled, button that is both non-functioning and the largest on the page.</p>
