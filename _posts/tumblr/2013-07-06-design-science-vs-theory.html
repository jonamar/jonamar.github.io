<blockquote>
<p>Wireframes, assets and flat compositions are the theory in the science of web design. You can quickly draft wireframes, produce visual assets as smaller, more robust theories whereas complete flat compositions are a larger, riskier theory â€” an attempt at finding a theory of everything.</p>
<p>Code on the other hand is where the real science happens. Using our elements, we can design with what we know to be true and work with facts rather than theories. We can use this science as a way of designing with real materials instead of asking our clients to sign off on a theory of a design that we are then contractually obliged to try and recreate with science.</p>
