<p>Two products that work hard to keep you from using them:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Shampoo Bottles</strong> with horrible tiny nubs that are meant to be used to open the shampoo bottles, but don&#8217;t work when hands are wet &amp; sudsy.</li>
<li><strong>Packets of Ketchup </strong>inevitably made slippery and impossible to open by junkfood-greased hands.</li>
</ol>
