<blockquote>
<p>A group of scientists figure out how to create life from raw atoms. They&#8217;re really excited. They challenge God to a contest, &#8220;We each start with a pile of dirt. Whoever creates the most exciting new life form wins. Kay?&#8221;</p>
<p>God says, &#8220;Deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The scientists grab a pile of dirt. </p>
<p><span>God says, &#8220;Get your own dirt.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><strong>Regarding the shoulders of gods and regular people.</strong></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/bb20a66ba99a5748c647c4c904bd7470/tumblr_inline_mk4328MaBV1qz4rgp.jpg" width="500"/></span></p>
<p><span>No matter how brilliant, a cavewoman (or man) would never have invented a rocket ship. Never. Ever. Ever.</span></p>
<p>We build on the ideas, the insights, and the technology created by those that came before us. Heck, even our bodies are the accumulations of eons of biological innovation. And yet&#8230; </p>

<p><strong>Going with the herd can feel so wrong. </strong></p>
<p>In a culture that prizes individuality, what is considered creativity is often no more than non-conformity. </p>
<p><span>Design is </span>creativity<span> with a purpose. Not blind, self-justifying, useless creativity. It is creation with intent, creation to solve a problem. </span><span>Yet, it&#8217;s so easy to want to come up with fresh solutions to the wrong problems.</span></p>
<p><strong>The age-old misstep: </strong></p>
<ol><li><span>"Our product is fresh and different!" to,</span></li>
<li><span>"Let&#8217;s make a website that is fresh and different." to,</span></li>
<li><span>"Everyone puts the menu at the top of the page, lets put ours on the bottom&#8230;" </span></li>
</ol><p><span>It seems like we went wrong in step three. But it really happened in step two. Making a website that is fresh and different is not the project goal. The goal is communicating the value of the fresh and different product to the people who will find it valuable. And even then, our products&#8217; uniqueness is not it&#8217;s true value to anyone — if is, we&#8217;re in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span><em>But I digressed. A lot.</em> </span></p>
<p><span>The thing about all this is that I recently wrapped my head around a really powerful concept: Design Patterns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Gentle Reader, meet Design Patterns. </strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re actually already well acquainted with the concept. When you visit a website and you know to look at the top for the main menu. When you go to a public washroom (in your home country) you know how to flush. Design Patterns – they&#8217;re everywhere. They&#8217;re all the things you&#8217;ve come to expect without even thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>Design Patterns are the solutions that you expect.</strong></p>
<p>They&#8217;re the solutions that everyone uses. Most of the time, they really good solutions. Other times, they&#8217;re just the solution people are used to (I&#8217;m tapping on you&#8230; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY#History_and_purposes">QWERTY keyboards</a>). Either way though, except for very unique situations (not yours), reinventing the wheel is simply the wrong solution to geting the metaphorical vehicle down the proverbial road.</p>
<p>Design Patterns catalogue solutions by refining them down to their essential elements so that they can be understood, implemented, and evolved. Chance are, next time you find yourself trying to solve a problem the answer will be, &#8220;<span>What did other people do before me?&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span>Here&#8217;s the Design Pattern library that made it all click for me, <a href="http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive/patterns.html">Responsive Patterns</a>.</span></p>
