<p>Technology, the web, has us all underneath this collective microscope of self-awareness. We often remark, in some combination of horror &amp; jest, that we&#8217;re wasting our lives on cat gifs and youtube memes.</p>
<p><em>Fast Company </em>recently published a great article exploring the view from the microscope stage back up. They problematize our assumptions that these memes are mindless and that sharing them is even less so. I found this paragraph particularly poignant (alliteration hat-trick!)</p>
<blockquote>
<div>In the language of the visual web, when we share a video or an image, we’re not just sharing the object, we’re also sharing in the emotional response it creates.</div>
</blockquote>
