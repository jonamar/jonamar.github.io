<blockquote>
<p>In the field of user experience, there’s a huge and unhelpful overemphasis on similarity, familiarity, and the ability to formally reason about interfaces. People are more nuanced. We respond based not only on experience or reason, but also on emotion and intuition.</p>
<p><strong>Too many interfaces run immediately to the well-worn toolbox of simulation and explicitness, imposing a cognitive straitjacket not only on the user, but also the designer. </strong>We too easily forget that the only thing that matters to people are their goals: their own tasks, and content. With limited attention, we want to devote our focus to what’s important, rather than distractions and artifice masquerading as design traditions.</p>

<p>A friend and I just shut down a design concept on one of our projects. It was such a delightful idea, it made people laugh, it felt perfectly appropriate to the task the app accomplishes. But<span> we worked through the details of implementation, it became apparent that this just wasn&#8217;t going to work. </span></p>
<p>Moving on was really painful. I&#8217;d fallen in love with this idea. I still feel like I lost a friend. <span>But it was the wrong solution. And so we moved on. </span><span>It&#8217;s nice to share the emotional hardships of creativity, they deserve openness and honoring. I don&#8217;t want to stop there though because I think there&#8217;s a lesson to be learned. </span></p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;let&#8217;s be delightful – that will make this app worthwhile&#8221;. And then we tried to be delightful. But we had it backwards. I should have said, &#8220;let&#8217;s make this so worthwhile that it delights people&#8221;.</p>
