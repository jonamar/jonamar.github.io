<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people seem to think that by adding more stuff to their products they&#8217;re actually increasing their customer base. But really, I find it to be the opposite. <strong>The fewer things your product does, the more people can use it.</strong> Because it&#8217;s less specific, more generic. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve found to be true. </p>

<p>— Brilliant insight by <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried">Jason Fried</a>, maker of <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp</a>, on the lovely podcast &#8220;<a href="http://hired.fm/">Hired</a>" by <a href="https://twitter.com/cameronmoll">Cameron Moll</a>, maker of <a href="http://www.authenticjobs.com/">Authentic Jobs</a>. The emphasis is mine.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all thought about how less is more. But typically that&#8217;s a matter of more easy to use, less fluff. I love the idea that it can also mean it&#8217;s more useful to more people.</p>
