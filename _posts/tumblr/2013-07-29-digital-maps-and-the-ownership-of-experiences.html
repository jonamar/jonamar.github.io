<p>Design is such a tricky thing. Building tools that people come to trust and rely on can create unexpected tensions. Sometimes you can do a job so well, people forget that these tools are fallible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> [Online Maps] give us a false sense of security and a false sense of reality: we forget that the map isn’t the territory.</p>
<p>We used to be more tentative with our paper maps or our friends’ directions. We tended to think about it more, rather than blindly follow.</p>
<p>We’ve decided that knowing where to go is <em>no longer our problem</em>, and getting lost is <em>no longer our fault</em>.</p>
<p>This might be a bit premature.</p>

<p>How do we solve this problem? Being less fallible hardly seems like the solution. Do we warn people? Do we remind them that humans make these products they use? A little humanity in our design is often a great thing and this might be one more reason why.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that Designers don&#8217;t hold all the responsibility for the creation of experiences. It&#8217;s most important for Designers, ourselves, to remember that.</p>
<p><span>At best, </span><a href="http://ia.net/blog/can-experience-be-designed-2/">experiences are co-created</a><span> by Designer &amp; User (two problematic words but that&#8217;s another discussion). The responsibility for our actions are — at least in large part — our own and that goes, too, for the ways in which we let the world and our tools impact us.</span></p>
