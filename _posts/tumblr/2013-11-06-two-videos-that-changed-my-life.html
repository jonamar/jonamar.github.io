<p>Both of these videos are impactful, inspiring, and actionable. Plus, they&#8217;re both masterclasses in giving presentations — in speaking to people and sharing ideas. I&#8217;m so excited that I found them.</p>
<p>The second video is particularly amazing. Joe Gebbia, the founder of AirBnB, is charming and full of wonderful, honest insights into how to realise your entrepreneurial dreams. It&#8217;s a pleasure to watch and a breeze at 20 or so minutes. </p>
<p>The first video though&#8230; is better. Way, way, way better. The first video is a video I will still be pondering 20 years from now. If I&#8217;ve gained your trust, any of it at all, I&#8217;d like to cash it all in, right now and place all my chips on video number one. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Thanks to the brilliant <a href="https://twitter.com/shimberger">@shimberger</a> for sharing video #2 with me. </p>
