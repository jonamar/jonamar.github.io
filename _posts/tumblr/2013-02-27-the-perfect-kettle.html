<p>Making a lot of tea for myself today and it got me daydreaming about the perfect kettle. And that reminded me about the old adage, put here nicely by Paul Rand (1914 - 1996) a brilliant American Graphic Designer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Ideas may also grow out of the problem itself, which in turn becomes part of the solution.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Design, in so many ways, is about problem solving and design thinking is about getting to know the problem you&#8217;re solving, intimately.</p>
